# Crop_Yield_Prediction_System
This was my first ML project and the dataset was about 1 million so, that CSV file was and possible to upload as it exceeded 25 MB criteria of github but let me give you some insights on that dataset.
It included 10 headers : Region, Soil Type, Crop, Rainfall, Use of Fertilizer, Temperature, Irrigation, Weather, Days_to_Harvest and Yield per hectare.
Region had 4 options:East, West, North and South.
Soil Type had 6 options: Chalky, Slit, Loam, Clay, Peaty, Sandy.
Crop had 6 options: Barley, Cotton, Maize, Soybean, Rice, Wheat.
Weather had 3 options: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy.
Fertilizer and Irrigation had True or False type input.
Rainfall, Temperature and Day_to_Harvest was taken in integers.
>>Yield per hectare was the output of all these inputs.
